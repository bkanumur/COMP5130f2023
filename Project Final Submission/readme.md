# Beyond the Pages

## Project Concept
The Beyond the Pages web app aims to provide an engaging platform for readers to explore and share their favorite books. The app focuses on user authentication, allowing readers to create accounts, log in, and personalize their reading experience. Users can track their reading progress, discover new books, and connect with other book enthusiasts. The project emphasizes a responsive and user-friendly design to enhance the overall experience.


### Project Overview: 
The web app facilitates user interaction with a database of books, allowing users to create profiles, log in securely, and engage with book-related content. Readers can explore a variety of books, mark favorites, and share their reading achievements with the community. The app encourages a sense of community among book lovers, fostering discussions and recommendations.

## Development Updates - Authentication Pages: Login & Registration:

1. Login Page: Enables existing users to log in securely, providing access to their personalized content and reading history.

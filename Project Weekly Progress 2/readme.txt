Title: BEYOND THE PAGES

Updating the previous project progress statement we added a few more functionalities with its backend, one thing I'm most proud of accomplishing this week.

I am most proud of adding more interesting features to the basic structure of the website, including the homepage, which includes signup and login pages and darkmode toogles. I'm proud of this because it's the foundation of our project and sets the stage of displaying in a better version and also we attached the js file which contains the functionalities for the html file. It's a significant step towards achieving our project goals.

Title: BEYOND THE PAGES

Updating the previous project progress statement we added designing of the page as well as a few more functionalities with its backend, one thing I'm most proud of accomplishing this week.

I am most proud of adding more interesting features to the basic structure of the website, including the homepage, which includes header and footer toogles. I'm proud of this because it's the the design of our project and sets the stage of displaying in a better version and also  makes the users interested in viewing the website. It's a significant step towards achieving our project goals.

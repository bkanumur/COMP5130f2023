Title: BEYOND THE PAGES

Updating the previous project progress statement, one thing I'm most proud of accomplishing this week is I learned how to create a data base.

I tried to implement the database connectivity but eventually failed. Did some research online to overcome these issues. And trying to fix the problems and bugs.

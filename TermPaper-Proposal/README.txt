Term-Paper- Title : Vulnerabilities, Testing and detection for a Web Application - A Survey  

Abstract: 
---------

Web application security is a pressing issue, as nearly all websites and online applications necessitate the collection of personal information from users.

Given the rising instances of unauthorized data access and privacy breaches, it is imperative for web developers to grasp the vulnerabilities inherent in web applications and to develop the ability to identify and assess potential threats.

This document will encompass a comprehensive examination of web-based threats such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and broken authentication. It will also delve into the methods for testing these vulnerabilities, enabling early detection to safeguard the security and confidentiality of valuable data and information.
